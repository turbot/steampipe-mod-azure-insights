## Overview

Dashboards can help answer questions like:

- How many resources do I have?
- How old are my resources?
- Are there any publicly accessible resources?
- Is encryption enabled and what keys are used for encryption?
- Is versioning enabled?
- What are the relationships between closely connected resources like compute virtual machines, disks, snapshots, and network?

Dashboards are available for Compute, Key Vault, SQL, and Storage services.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install Powerpipe (https://powerpipe.io/downloads), or use Brew:

```sh
brew install turbot/tap/powerpipe
```

This mod also requires [Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) with the [Azure plugin](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/azure) and the [Azure Active Directory plugin](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/azuread) as the data source. Install Steampipe (https://steampipe.io/downloads), or use Brew:

```sh
brew install turbot/tap/steampipe
steampipe plugin install azure
steampipe plugin install azuread
```

Steampipe will automatically use your default Azure and Azure Active Directory credentials. Optionally, you can [setup multiple subscriptions](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/azure#multi-subscription-connections) for Azure or [customize Azure credentials](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/azure#configuring-azure-credentials) or you can [setup multiple tenants](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/azuread#multi-tenant-connections) for Azure Active Directory or [customize Azure Active Directory credentials](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/azuread#configuring-azure-active-directory-credentials).

Finally, install the mod:

```sh
mkdir dashboards
cd dashboards
powerpipe mod init
powerpipe mod install github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-azure-insights
```

### Browsing Dashboards

Start Steampipe as the data source:

```sh
steampipe service start
```

Start the dashboard server:

```sh
powerpipe server
```

Browse and view your dashboards at **http://localhost:9033**.
